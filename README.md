# End-to-End AI Systems

A collection of **system-oriented AI projects** focused on building
**complete, deployable AI pipelines** rather than isolated models.

This repository emphasizes **AI engineering**, demonstrating how large
language models, computer vision, and agent-based systems can be composed
into **end-to-end applications** with real-world constraints.

---

## Motivation

Many AI projects stop at model training or experimentation.
This repository focuses on **bridging the gap between models and usable
systems** by designing pipelines that can be integrated, extended,
and deployed.

---

## What This Repository Focuses On

- Designing **end-to-end AI pipelines**
- Integrating multiple AI components into application workflows
- Building modular systems that support experimentation and reuse
- Handling practical concerns such as orchestration and extensibility

---

## Covered System Types

- Local and API-based LLM applications
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
- Agentic and multi-agent AI workflows
- Real-time voice and conversational AI systems
- Computer vision pipelines (e.g., Visual Question Answering)
- Diffusion-based image generation systems
- Game-playing and decision-making AI agents

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **LangChain**, **LangGraph**
- **Llama 3**, **Gemini API**
- **FAISS**, **ChromaDB**
- **PyTorch**
- **Whisper**, **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**
- **Diffusion Models**

## Repository Structure

Each directory represents a **standalone end-to-end system** with its own
logic, dependencies, and documentation.

## Engineering Emphasis

This repository prioritizes:
- **Pipeline orchestration** and component interaction
- Designing AI beyond standalone models
- Building systems that can evolve from experimentation
  to real-world application usage

---

## Note

The focus of this repository is on **system design and integration**.
Individual model training details and datasets are documented within
their respective subprojects where applicable.
